### Overview

**Aim**  
Teach participants the tools needed to publish their code in a journal such as The Journal of Open Source Software

**Context**  
A growing number of researchers use and write code for their research. This code should be published to enable reproducibile and extensible research, and to help ensure that researchers can gain credit for their research outputs, but this is not currently widespread practice. There are different ways code can be made available - eg: a code snippet on a blog, emailed on request, or an interactive notebook available as supplementary information. For more substantial pieces of code there is also a growing number of journals which are focused on the review and publishing of scientific software. The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is one such journal, and requires that the code is tested, documented and undergoes peer review - ie, it encourages "best practice" in scientific software engineering.

**Audience**  
Researchers who...
- currently code (ideally, Python or R)
- want to publish their code in JOSS or similar, but do not have all of the skills/knowledge in place
- want to build confidence around the tools for documentation/testing

**Timing**  
Two days, 10-5pm with 2 hours for breaks = 10 hours of workshop time.

**Location**  
London, TBC.

**Participant pre-requisites**  
version control (git), a programming language, basic bash, code available on github or similar.

**Teaching materials**  
The ["Get your code publication ready"](https://lucydot.github.io/publication-ready) workshop materials are currently being developed. These will incorporate materials from the [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org).

**Project Partners**  
CodeRefinery, [RSLondon](https://rslondon.ac.uk) and the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk)

### Course Contents

*Note: The lesson is structured around the submission criteria for [The Journal of Open Source Software](joss.theoj.org), however this aligns well with the submission criteria for other journals such as [The Journal of Open Research Software](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/)*

*Note: Examples will be in Python, as this is a widely used and readable language. Language-specific groups will form for the activities OR there will be examples for Python and R.*

See the [course contents table](workshop_contents.md) - this is in development.

See [example workshop timings](example_workshop_timings.md) - also in development.

### Pre-course questionnaire

- Assess the current level of participants - which tools are currently used.
- Confirm that they have basic git skills
- Ask for a link to code available online (could be a script on github) - *or is this too high an entrance barrier?*
- Ask if they are interested in participating in a pre-submission code review after the workshop

### Pre-submission code review

- To provide support/confidence prior to JOSS (or equivalent) submission
- Short 30 minute review (possibly online), going through the journal criteria
- Provide tool or checklist to aid with the review
