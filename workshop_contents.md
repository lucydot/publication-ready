| Motivation  | \*Why should we publish our code?  | \*code refinery lesson "social coding and open research"  ||
| Software journals   | \*Which journals can we publish in </br> \*What is the submission criteria?  |  \*http://www.codeisscience.com/journal_table.html  | Focus on JOSS|
| Case Study  | \*What does a successful submission look like?  | \*Accepted or pre-review submissions to JOSS  | Participants work in pairs to look at a software project and discuss how JOSS criteria is met |
| Introduction to JOSS | \*How do we submit a project to JOSS? </br> \*What is the JOSS review process? |  |Invite JOSS topic editor? </br> Could combine at end of first day with drinks for informal session |
| Structuring your project | \*How should we structure a software package? </br> \*When and how do we release software versions? | \*code refinery lesson "reproducible research"| |

|Code review| \*How can we conduct *constructive* code reviews?| | Ask Alex Hill to deliver this? https://www.alexandra-hill.com/2018/06/25/the-art-of-giving-and-receiving-code-reviews/ |
| Peer code review | \*What next steps should we take towards publishing our code? | | Participants work in pairs: 15 minutes to look at each others code, 15 minutes to identify what the next steps are towards publishing the code |
| Modular code developement | \*How do we write easily extensible code? | \* code refindery lesson "modular code development"| I think this is difficult to teach in a short time frame - not sure whether to include or not? |
